            Why Interactives?
        </H2>
        <p>
            In the spring of 2024, I enrolled in Northwestern's Interactive Storytelling course. I've never had any experience coding or making interactive journalism pieces before, but this class sparked my interest! I look forward to making many more interactives in the future and I can't wait to learn how to improve.

            What Have I Learned So Far?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I've learned many different skills, such as how to display points on a map and using tools such as Flourish and Mapbox. I look forward to implementing these skills in further practices!
