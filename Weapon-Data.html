 From 2016 to 2021, many weapons of all sorts were recovered in Evanston. Here is a graph that shows each weapon and the means of which it was recovered.

    Should Evanston be worried?
</h2>
<p>
    Because this data hasn't been updated in three years, it's uncertain if current statistics follow the trends above. However, if history repeats itself, Evanston citizens have little to worry about. Although the handgun statistics seems daunting at first, most were simply recovered or turned in, with a very little amount being used as evidence for a crime.
